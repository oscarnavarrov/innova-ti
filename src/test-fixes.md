# Debugging "Failed to fetch" Errors üîç

## Current Issue
Getting "Failed to fetch" errors when making PATCH requests to update tickets:
```
‚ùå API Call failed (Hook): {
  "endpoint": "/tickets/1",
  "method": "PATCH", 
  "error": "Failed to fetch",
  "hasToken": true,
  "isAuthenticated": true
}
```

## Debugging Steps Taken

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration ‚úÖ
- Added explicit PATCH method to allowMethods
- Added comprehensive headers to allowHeaders
- Added explicit OPTIONS handler for preflight requests
- Increased maxAge to 86400 seconds

### 2. Enhanced Server Logging ‚úÖ
- Added detailed logging to PATCH endpoint
- Added request headers and body logging
- Added database operation logging

### 3. Enhanced Client Logging ‚úÖ
- Created useApiCall hook with detailed logging
- Added request/response logging
- Added network error detection

### 4. Added Test Endpoints ‚úÖ
- Added `/health` endpoint (no auth required)
- Added `/test` endpoint (auth required)
- Added test button in TicketDetails for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Use the "Test API" button in ticket details to verify connectivity
2. Check browser network tab for actual HTTP requests
3. Check server logs for incoming requests
4. Verify CORS preflight handling

## Server Endpoints
- Health: `GET /make-server-2e05cbde/health` (no auth)
- Test: `GET /make-server-2e05cbde/test` (auth required)
- Update Ticket: `PATCH /make-server-2e05cbde/tickets/:id` (auth required)
